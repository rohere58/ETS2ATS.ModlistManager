FAQ – ETS2/ATS Modlist Manager (EN)
===================================

1. Why are some mods not detected?
   The previous workshop/file presence feature was removed to simplify the UI.

2. Where are my modlists stored?
   In the "modlists" folder next to the executable.

3. How do I share a modlist?
   Use Menu Modlists → Share… to create a portable file.

4. Can I use custom logos?
   Yes: place `Resources/Logos/logo.png` (ETS2). ATS override may follow.

5. Where do I add list notes?
   Bottom text area "Infos zur Modliste" – saved automatically.

6. Change language?
   Options → Language. A restart is recommended afterwards.

(More questions can be added later.)
